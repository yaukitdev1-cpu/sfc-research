# Key Decisions & Rationale

*Important decisions made during the research process and the reasoning behind them.*

## Documentation Standards

### Decision: Dated File Naming
**Rationale:** SFC website structure changes over time. Dated files (`YYYYMMDD_description.md`) help track when research was conducted and identify potentially stale findings.

### Decision: Separate Raw Research from Processed Findings
**Rationale:** Raw research notes capture the discovery process with all its messiness. Processed findings in `findings/` provide clean, synthesized insights for decision-making. This separation allows both granular detail and high-level summaries to coexist.

## Repository Structure

### Decision: Domain-Based Organization
**Rationale:** Research naturally clusters around domains (APIs, documents, scraping, structure). Organizing by domain makes it easier to find related research and identify gaps.
